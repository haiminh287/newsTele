🇬🇧 Sterling Falls to 10-Week Low

The British pound fell to $1.336, the lowest since May 20, as weak UK data shifted market focus from inflation to slowing growth while trade optimism lifted the US currency. While warm weather boosted food sales, overall economic momentum remains fragile, with recent PMI data disappointing. This has fueled expectations that the Bank of England may cut interest rates by 25 basis points in August, with another cut likely by year-end, as it shifts focus to supporting growth. Meanwhile, the US dollar strengthened after the US and EU reached a trade deal imposing 15% tariffs on most EU exports, including cars. The agreement, announced by President Trump and EU President von der Leyen, eased trade war fears just before a tariff deadline, giving the dollar a further boost.

🇧🇷 Ibovespa Gains Ahead of US Tariff Decision

The Ibovespa rose 0.3% toward 132,500 on Tuesday amid modest gains for corporate giants, while attention remains on Brazil’s position in trade talks with the US ahead of the August 1st deadline for potential 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods deadline for potential 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods. Finance Minister Fernando Haddad said Vice President Geraldo Alckmin held a third and extended call with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, adding that Brazil is confident it will succeed in securing favorable terms. Lutnick said President Trump will decide on the deals by August 1st. Meanwhile, the IMF raised Brazil’s growth forecast for 2026 but still sees a slight deceleration ahead. Vale ( 0.6%) and Petrobras ( 0.2%) advanced, along with major banks Banco do Brasil ( 0.2%) and Itaú Unibanco ( 0.3%).

IMF Raises Global Growth Forecasts, Warns of Lingering Risks

The IMF projected global economic growth at 3.0% in 2025 and 3.1% in 2026, slightly higher than previous forecasts from April 2025. The upward revision—by 0.2 pp for 2025 and 0.1 for 2026—reflects stronger-than-expected early economic activity in anticipation of higher tariffs, lower-than-expected US tariff rates, improved financial conditions due in part to a weaker USD, and fiscal expansion in several major economies. Despite the slightly improved outlook, the IMF warns that risks remain tilted to the downside. A rebound in tariffs or failure to reach lasting trade agreements could dampen growth. Growth forecasts for key economies include the US at 1.9% in 2025 and 2.0% in 2026, the Eurozone at 1.0% and 1.2%, and the UK at 1.2% and 1.4%. China’s growth was revised up to 4.8% and 4.2%, while Japan is expected to grow more modestly at 0.7% and 0.5%. Meanwhile, global inflation is expected to ease to 4.2% in 2025 and 3.6% in 2026, although it is likely to remain above target in the US.
🇺🇸 US Job Quits Fall to 6-Month Low

The number of job quits in the US fell by 128,000 to 3.142 million in June 2025, down from a downwardly revised 3.270 million in May and below the 3.284 million recorded a year earlier. It was the lowest level since December 2024. The quits rate—which measures voluntary job departures as a share of total employment—held steady at 2.0%. The decline in quits was most notable in professional and business services (-114,000), state and local government education (-20,000), and the federal government (-5,000). Regionally, job quits declined sharply in the South (-136,000) and the Midwest (-39,000), but increased in the West ( 42,000) and Northeast ( 6,000).
🇲🇽 Mexican Peso at 1-Month Low

The Mexican peso weakened past 18.8 per USD, reaching one-month lows as a resurgent US dollar, buoyed by a string of trade breakthroughs, including headline 15% tariffs under the new US–EU and US–Japan pacts, has lifted expectations for stronger US growth and a steadfast Federal Reserve. Domestically, a sharply narrowed June merchandise surplus and softer industrial output compounded concerns that Mexico’s export engines are losing steam just as looming US tariff deadlines inject fresh uncertainty. However, the peso’s losses have been capped by Mexico’s exceptionally tight labor market, unemployment came at 2.7% in June, the lowest since 2002, alongside still-elevated Banxico rates underpinned by sticky core inflation, which together sustain higher real yields and attract carry-trade inflows.
🇺🇸 Dallas Fed General Business Activity Rebounds

The Dallas Fed's general business activity index jumped 6.4 points from the previous month to 2 in July of 2025, the first positive reading since February, to reflect fresh optimism among the district's business activity. The result was in line with improving leading indicators in the US as a series of agreements by White House officials drove tariff threats do de-escalate, likely reducing inflation expectations. The revenue index surged by 10.4 points to 6.3. In the meantime, employment increased by 4 to 2.8 and wages rose by 15.6 to 13.4. Consistently, the index measuring expectations of future revenue remained high at 31.1, although the figure was 2.1 points below that from June.
🇺🇸 US 10 Year Treasury Bond Note Yield at 4.36percent

The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note fell to 4.36% on Tuesday as markets assessed the outlook on US borrowing against an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. Primary dealers for Treasuries expect the US to refrain from increasing auction sizes for the incoming third quarter, in line with their earlier estimates, amid close scrutiny on US borrowing following debt-limit volatility and an expansionary fiscal bill passed by US President Trump. In the meantime, the US and the EU agreed to loose terms on future trade, but investors stressed uncertainty over disagreements as the counterparties start to discuss finer details to the deal. Wider tariffs, including higher rates on other major US trading partners, are set to be enforced on Friday. In the meantime, the Fed is expected to hold interest rates unchanged on Wednesday as the pro-inflationary risks from tariffs coincide with evidence of a robust economy, although rate futures reflect bets of two rate cuts this year.
US Natgas Prices Rise from 10-Week Low

US natural gas futures rose to $3.16/MMBtu, rebounding from a ten-week low of $3.066 in the previous session, as forecasts for extreme August heat lifted demand expectations. Meteorologists expect hotter-than-normal temperatures across much of the US, particularly in the Southeast, mid-South, and Midwest, driving increased use of air conditioning and boosting power sector gas consumption. Geopolitical tensions also added support, after President Trump shortened the timeline for Russia to agree to a Ukraine ceasefire, raising the risk of further sanctions on Russian energy exports. Additionally, a new US-EU agreement includes a pledge from the EU to spend $750 billion on US energy products, including gas. Still, supply remains strong, with average output in the Lower 48 reaching 107.5 bcfd in July, above June’s record. Meanwhile, Baker Hughes announced a $13.6 billion deal to acquire Chart Industries, outbidding Flowserve and signaling continued consolidation in the oil and gas sector.
🇧🇷 Brazilian Real Hovers Near 1-Month Low

The Brazilian real traded around 5.58 per USD, hovering near early-June lows, as an outsized rebound in the greenback, fueled by US–EU and US–Japan trade pacts capping tariff escalation fears and underpinning expectations of a stronger US economy and a steadfast Fed, has overwhelmed local currency flows. Domestically, mounting anxiety over President Trump’s imminent 50% tariff on Brazilian exports, slated for August?1st, has prompted exporters to hedge receivables and repatriate dollars early. At the same time, Brazil’s central bank is trapped between a still-elevated 5.3% mid-July IPCA-15 inflation print, and a 15% Selic rate that looks set to remain unchanged, limiting its ability to defend the economy via rate cuts or aggressive dovish signaling. Although Copom’s high real yields continue to attract carry-trade inflows and Brazil’s record agricultural shipments offer intermittent FX support, these forces have so far only tempered, rather than reversed, the real’s slide.
Oil Picks Up for 2nd Session

WTI crude oil futures rose more than 1% to $67.5 per barrel on Tuesday, extending a 2.4% gain in the previous session driven by stronger-than-expected US economic data and growing concerns over global supply risks. President Trump warned Russia of “secondary sanctions” if it doesn’t agree to a Ukraine ceasefire within 10–12 days, with the Kremlin signaling no change in stance. The warning follows fresh EU sanctions on Russia, which also impacted India’s Nayara Energy, forcing it to cut refinery output. On the macro front, US consumer confidence beat expectations, supporting optimism around demand. Attention now turns to the Aug. 1 trade deal deadline and the upcoming OPEC  meeting that will decide September output levels. Oil is on track for a third straight monthly gain, supported by strong summer demand and tight inventories in key regions. However, a potential supply glut later in the year looms as OPEC  continues raising production.
🇬🇧 FTSE 100 Rises to New Record High

The FTSE 100 rose over 0.5% to a new record high on Tuesday, lifted by strong corporate earnings and improved sentiment around the UK economy. AstraZeneca shares jumped 3.5% after reporting solid second-quarter results, driven by strong cancer drug sales and reaffirmed guidance. Barclays also advanced 2.5% despite a mixed report, as its investment banking division outperformed, aligning with peers benefiting from trade-related market volatility. Greggs reported a 7% rise in first-half revenue, overcoming weaker footfall due to the hot weather. Adding to the upbeat tone, the IMF forecast that UK economic growth will surpass other major European economies this year and next. On the housing front, Zoopla data showed a rise in demand during July, while mortgage approvals in June slightly exceeded expectations, pointing to signs of resilience in the UK property market.
European Stocks Rebound

European stocks closed higher on Tuesday, rebounding from losses in the previous session as a batch of optimistic corporate earnings weighed against unilateral tariffs from the US. The Eurozone's STOXX 50 added 0.7% to 5,376 and the pan-European STOXX 600 rose by a softer 0.2% to 550, weighed Novo Nordisk shares. EssilorLuxotica surged 6.4% after reporting a higher operating profit, despite facing tariff-related headwinds. Banks also performed well after a period of more muted movements, with Santander, BBVA, and Intesa Sanpaolo each gaining more than 2%. In turn, Stellantis recouped sharp losses from earlier in the session and closed marginally in the green after reporting a first-half net loss of €2.3 billion. Outside the Eurozone, AstraZeneca gained 3.5% following its earnings release, and Barclays posted better-than-expected profits and announced a £1 billion share buyback. On the other hand, Novo Nordisk plunged 22% after issuing a profit warning and changing its CEO.

WTI Surges Over 3% to 5-Week High

WTI crude oil futures surged 3.7% to settle at $69.20 per barrel on Tuesday, marking a five-week high and extending Monday’s 2.4% gain, as easing trade tensions and rising geopolitical risks fueled supply concerns. Optimism was boosted by a US-EU trade agreement that helped avoid a full-scale conflict, improving the outlook for global fuel demand. The deal also included a commitment from the EU to purchase $750 billion in US energy, though analysts remain doubtful about the feasibility of meeting that target. Further supporting prices, President Trump intensified pressure on Russia by setting a shorter deadline for progress in ending the Ukraine war and threatening new sanctions. On the macroeconomic front, stronger-than-expected US consumer confidence added to demand optimism. Investors are also closely watching the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting this week, where rates are expected to remain unchanged, though a dovish shift in tone may emerge amid signs of cooling inflation.

🇧🇷 Ibovespa Rebounds on Tuesday

The Ibovespa climbed 0.5% to close at 132,726 on Tuesday as a combination of easing trade-war anxieties, firming commodity prices and corporate catalysts lifted Brazil’s benchmark. Renewed US–China tariff-truce talks and the US–EU framework agreement capped the threat of broader duties on Brazilian exports, providing relief to agribusiness and industrial names, while Brent crude’s jump above $72 on fresh Russia–Ukraine sanctions fears underpinned oil-and-gas producers. At the same time, Embraer rallied 2.5% after the government signaled contingency support to shield its jet exports from the looming 50% US tariff. On the macro front, stronger-than-expected July business-confidence readings and IMF comments that Brazil’s fiscal trajectory remains manageable reinforced hopes that the Central Bank will maintain a steady Selic at this week’s Copom meeting—balancing inflation control with growth support.
🇺🇸 US Crude Inventories Unexpectedly Rise

US crude oil inventoriessurged by 1.539 million barrels in the week ending July 25, 2025, sharply reversing the previous week’s 577,000-barrel draw. The unexpected build surprised markets, which had widely anticipated a 2.5 million-barrel decline.
🇨🇱 Chile Lowers Interest Rate by 25 bps

The Central Bank of Chile cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.75% in a unanimous decision during its July meeting, citing persistent global uncertainty and mixed domestic signals. While the Israel-Iran conflict has ended, military tensions linger, and the US has introduced new tariffs, including on Brazil and copper, raising global trade concerns. Despite these developments, international financial markets have reacted mildly, and Chile’s economy continues to align with projections in the June Monetary Policy Report. Inflation came in lower than expected in June, with headline CPI falling 0.4% month-on-month, though core inflation remained flat. Domestically, consumption and investment have grown, but the labor market shows weak job creation and a rising unemployment rate. The Bank reaffirmed its commitment to guiding inflation toward the 3% target over a two-year horizon, signaling a flexible approach to future rate decisions.

🇺🇸 US-China Mull Tariff Truce Extension Ahead of Deadline

The U.S. and China are continuing talks to maintain a tariff truce set to expire in two weeks, with President Trump to make the final decision on any extension, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday. The Stockholm talks marked the third round of negotiations in under three months, concluding ahead of the August 12 deadline for resolving differences during a 90-day suspension of steep tariffs that had threatened to disrupt trade between the world’s two largest economies. Extending the truce by another 90 days remains an option, Bessent said. “There’s still a couple of technical details to work out,” he noted after two days of talks with officials led by China’s Vice-Premier He Lifeng. Chinese negotiator Li Chenggang said both sides agreed to uphold the truce, calling the talks “candid, in-depth and geared for continued close communication,” though he gave no timeline.
🇺🇸 US Futures Steady Ahead of Fed Decision

🇮🇳 IMF Revises Up India’s GDP Forecast to 6.4% for FY 2026

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday upgraded its fiscal year 2025–26 (FY 2026) economic growth forecasts for India, citing a more favourable global economic situation.

In its World Economic Outlook report, the IMF said that India’s growth outlook reflects a more benign external environment than assumed in the April reference forecast. It maintained its FY 2025 growth estimate at 6.5%, underscoring the economy’s strength despite global headwinds. Separately, on Monday, the Finance Ministry’s Monthly Economic Review for June mentioned that the economy has the look and feel of “steady as she goes” as far as FY26 is concerned, as The Economic Times reported.

🇺🇸 Dollar Eases Ahead of Fed Decision

The US dollar index dipped to around 98.7 on Wednesday, snapping a four-day winning streak as investors turned cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy announcement. The Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged, though markets are focused on any signals pointing to a possible rate cut in September. President Donald Trump has continued to pressure the Fed to lower borrowing costs. Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, both seen as contenders to lead the central bank, are expected to dissent at this month’s meeting. Investors are also watching upcoming data releases on private payrolls, GDP, and pending home sales for further clues on the strength of the US economy. On the trade front, US-China talks in Stockholm ended Tuesday without an extension of the current truce. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that any deal will require Trump’s personal approval before moving forward.
🇺🇸 U.S. Clears Nvidia Chip Sales to China to Maintain AI Edge

White House National Economic Adviser Kevin Hassett said the Trump administration allowed Nvidia’s H20 AI chip shipments to China in a strategic move to maintain the U.S. lead in advanced chip development. Referring to the decision, Hassett said, “President Trump and his team decided to let the NVIDIA chips go” to avoid giving China room to innovate and potentially surpass the U.S. in chip technology. Nvidia recently stated it is applying for U.S. government licenses to resume H20 chip sales to China and expects approval soon. The H20 is the most advanced chip Nvidia can legally offer in China, though it has reduced computing power compared to global versions due to previous export restrictions under both Trump and Biden administrations. “If China’s not buying chips from us, then they’re innovating, making their own chips,” Hassett warned, emphasizing the importance of staying ahead in the global AI chip race.
🇦🇺 Australia Monthly CPI Hits Over 4-Year Low

Australia’s monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 1.9% in June 2025, easing from both May’s figure and market forecasts of 2.1%, and marking the lowest level since March 2021. The reading also came in below the central bank’s target range of 2–3%.
🇵🇭 Philippines Trade Deficit Narrows in June

The Philippines’ trade deficit narrowed to USD 3.95 billion in June 2025 from USD 4.34 billion in the same month last year. Exports climbed 26.1% year-on-year to USD 7.02 billion, driven by a surge in electronic product sales ( 30%), particularly electronic data processing ( 54.1%), office equipment ( 39.4%), and semiconductors ( 24.6%). Notably, gold exports soared 130.9% amid increased safe-haven demand due to global trade uncertainties following US tariffs. The US accounted for the largest share of exports (17.3%), followed by Hong Kong (15.2%), and Japan (13.9%). Meanwhile, imports rose 10.8% to USD 10.97 billion, attributed to increased purchases of telecommunications equipment and electrical machinery ( 69.6%), and transport equipment ( 66.1%). China remained the top import source, accounting for 28.2%, followed by Japan (7.9%), and South Korea (7.8%).For the first half of the year, the trade deficit narrowed to USD 23.97 billion from USD 25.06 billion in 2024.

🇦🇺 Aussie Dollar Holds Ground Despite Softer Inflation Print

The Australian dollar edged higher to above $0.651 on Wednesday, ending its four-session losing streak, as a weaker US dollar outweighed soft domestic inflation figures. The greenback eased ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy decision, with expectations for a rate hold, though markets remained cautious about any signals hinting at a possible cut in September. In Australia, consumer prices rose at the slowest pace in over four years in Q2, with headline CPI at 0.7% QoQ and 2.1% YoY, and core inflation easing to a three-year low of 2.7% YoY—both below forecasts and within the RBA’s 2–3% target range. The weaker inflation print reinforced dovish expectations, and markets have now fully priced in a 25 basis point rate cut at the RBA’s August meeting. On the trade front, caution lingered as US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick ruled out any delay to President Trump’s Friday tariff deadline, while separate talks with China ended without progress on pausing further duties.
Gold Stays Close to 3-Week Low

Gold hovered around $3,320 per ounce on Wednesday, staying near a three-week low as easing trade tensions reduced the metal’s safe-haven appeal.

With additional talks ongoing with Canada, South Korea, and others, investors are increasingly optimistic that further escalations can be avoided. Meanwhile, the US and China are continuing discussions to extend a tariff truce set to expire in two weeks, with President Trump expected to make the final decision on any extension. Investors are also closely watching the FOMC decision due today. While the Fed is widely expected to keep rates unchanged, markets will focus on Chair Powell’s press conference for any signals of a possible rate cut in September. Attention is also turning to a series of key US economic reports. So far this week, job openings came in slightly below expectations, while consumer confidence ticked higher.
🇺🇸 US 10-Year Yield Holds Decline Ahead of Fed

The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note held around 4.33% on Wednesday following a sharp drop in the previous session, as investors adopted a cautious stance ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy announcement. The Fed is widely expected to keep rates unchanged, but market participants are focused on any guidance suggesting a potential rate cut in September. President Donald Trump has continued to pressure the Fed to lower borrowing costs. Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, both seen as contenders to lead the central bank, are expected to dissent at this month’s meeting. Investors are also eyeing upcoming economic data, including private payrolls, GDP, and pending home sales, to further assess the health of the economy. Meanwhile, trade uncertainty persisted after US-China talks in Stockholm ended Tuesday without a deal to extend the current truce. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said any agreement would require Trump’s final approval.
🇨🇳 Offshore Yuan Steady as US-China Talks End

The offshore yuan steadied around 7.17 per dollar on Wednesday, following the conclusion of two days of ‘constructive’ US-China trade negotiations in Sweden. During the talks, both sides agreed to pursue an extension of the 90-day tariff truce, set to expire on August 12, in an effort to ease tensions in the ongoing trade war between the world’s two largest economies. Despite this progress, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized that President Trump retains final authority over all trade agreements, including any decision regarding the truce. Nevertheless, Bessent downplayed concerns that Trump would oppose an extension. He warned, however, that without a deal by the deadline, US tariffs on Chinese goods would revert to the triple-digit levels seen in April. In China, investors are turning their attention to upcoming PMI data, due tomorrow, for insights into the country’s economic outlook amid mounting domestic challenges and global trade uncertainty.
🇦🇺 Australia 10-Year Yield Falls on Soft Inflation Data

Australia’s 10-year government bond yield dropped to 4.27%, approaching a three-week low, after a surprisingly benign inflation report strengthened expectations of an interest rate cut next month. Headline inflation eased to 2.1% in the second quarter, from 2.4% in the previous period and slightly below the forecast of 2.2%. More significantly, the "trimmed mean" measure of inflation—the Reserve Bank’s preferred gauge of underlying price pressures—slowed to 2.7% from 2.9%, marking further progress within the central bank’s 2–3% target band. The inflation print follows a weak jobs report, which showed the first clear sign of softening in what has been a notably resilient labor market. Markets are now pricing in a near 100% probability of a 25bps cut at the RBA’s next meeting in August, with rates expected to fall to 3.10% by year-end.
🇰🇷 South Korean Won Rises Amid Softer Dollar, Trade Optimism

The South Korean won strengthened to around 1,382 per dollar on Wednesday, recovering losses from the previous session as the US dollar softened amid renewed concerns over a potential Fed rate cut in September. Sentiment was also supported by Seoul’s diplomatic push, with high-level trade talks between South Korean officials and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in Washington to avert looming US tariffs on Korean exports. Finance Minister Koo Yun-cheol is also set to meet US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, with talks reportedly including a major shipbuilding investment plan. Meanwhile, Samsung Chairman Lee Jae-yong’s unexpected US visit has fueled optimism. Lee may possibly reinforce Korea’s value as a strategic tech partner by highlighting a $37 billion chip investment plan and a $16.5 billion AI chip deal with Tesla, as trade tensions remain high before Friday’s tariff deadline. This visit could help ease US trade pressure and boost investor confidence in Korea’s export outlook.
Shares in Hong Kong  Extend Weakness  on Trade, Fed Jitters

Hong Kong stocks fell for the second session, down 46 points or 0.2% to 25,469 on Wednesday morning, after U.S.-China trade talks ended without a meaningful breakthrough. While extending the current tariff truce remains possible, Treasury Secretary Bessent said President Trump will have the final say. Caution also prevailed ahead of the Fed’s rate decision later today, with analysts noting most Fed officials prefer to wait and assess the inflationary impact of tariffs before acting—especially with Trump’s August 1 tariff deadline looming. Tech shares led the fall, followed by consumers and property, as traders awaited official and private PMI data for July. Losses were partially offset by gains in mainland Chinese stocks, buoyed by Beijing’s rollout of a national childcare subsidy aimed at lifting the country’s birth rate—just ahead of the key Politburo meeting later this month. Among early laggards were Li Auto (-10.5%), SMIC (-3.7%), Techtronic Inds. (-3.0%), and Pop Mart (-2.8%).
🇸🇬 Singapore Jobless Rate Ticks Up to 2.1% in Q2

Singapore’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate edged up to 2.1% in the second quarter of 2025, from 2.0% in the previous quarter, a preliminary estimate showed. This marked the highest level since the first quarter of 2024, though it still reflects a resilient labor market amid continued economic growth. Total employment rose significantly during the quarter (8,400 vs 2,300 in Q1), driven by larger gains in both resident and non-resident employment. Meanwhile, the number of retrenchments remained stable (3,500 vs 3,590), with most sectors seeing similar or lower levels. Business reorganization or restructuring remained the leading cause of job cuts. However, signs of softening continued to emerge in some outward-oriented sectors, particularly in professional services and information and communications. Looking ahead, persistent global economic uncertainty may weigh on hiring and wage growth, especially in sectors exposed to external demand.
🇳🇿 NZ Dollar Rebounds as US Dollar Softens

The New Zealand dollar rose to around $0.596 on Wednesday after four consecutive sessions of losses, supported by a weaker US dollar. The greenback retreated as investors turned cautious ahead of the US Federal Reserve's policy decision. While the Fed is widely expected to hold interest rates steady, investors will be watching closely for any hints of a potential rate cut in September. On the trade front, the US and China concluded two days of talks described by both sides as “constructive,” agreeing to continue working to extend their 90-day tariff truce. However, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted that any extension would ultimately depend on President Donald Trump, leaving a degree of uncertainty in the outlook. In domestic news, New Zealand’s business confidence improved further in July, but conditions remain challenging for many firms, with forward-looking activity indicators showing little momentum.
🇮🇳 Trump Signals 20–25% Tariff on India Amid Ongoing Trade Talks

U.S. President Donald Trump said Tuesday that India could face a tariff of 20–25%, slightly below the 26% rate announced in April, though a final decision has yet to be made as trade talks continue ahead of the August 1 deadline. When asked if that rate was likely, Trump replied, “I think so,” while noting, “India has been a good friend, but India has charged basically more tariffs than almost any other country. You just can't do that.” A tariff of 20% or higher would disappoint India, which had hoped for a better deal than the 19% offered to Indonesia and the Philippines. Bloomberg News previously reported that both countries were exploring a compromise to bring the rate below 20%, but progress was slow as India pushed back against U.S. demands to open up its agricultural and dairy markets.
Copper Gains as Chile Seeks US Tariff Exemption

Copper futures climbed above $5.65 per pound on Wednesday, recouping losses from earlier in the week after Chile’s finance minister announced plans to request an exemption from new US import tariffs. As the largest supplier of copper to the US, Chile’s position is central to ongoing trade negotiations. The Trump administration is set to impose a 50% tariff on copper imports starting August 1, though uncertainty remains over which forms and sources of copper will be affected. In response, traders have been accelerating shipments to the US ahead of the deadline. However, analysts warn that demand for US-bound copper could decline sharply once the tariffs are enforced. Adding to market caution, US-China trade talks in Stockholm ended Tuesday without an agreement to extend the current truce. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said any deal would require President Donald Trump’s final approval.
Palm Oil Extends Gains

Malaysian palm oil futures rose modestly to above MYR 4,260 per tonne, building on slight gains from the prior session amid a weaker ringgit and stronger rival Dalian oils. Meanwhile, demand from top buyer India may remain firm ahead of the Diwali festival in mid-October. Separately, top producer Indonesia projected its palm oil exports to India will exceed 5 million tonnes this year, up from 4.8 million tonnes in 2024. However, further gains were limited by caution after U.S.-China trade talks ended without a meaningful breakthrough, with President Trump expected to make the final call on tariffs. In China, official and private PMI data for July are due in the coming days, adding to concerns over deflation risks and the impact of global trade barriers. On the export front, shipments likely weakened in July, as cargo surveyors noted Malaysian palm oil exports for July 1–25 fell between 9.2% and 15.2% from June. Production is also expected to rise in H2 amid improved labor conditions.
🇳🇱 Dutch Business Confidence Remains Subdued

The Netherlands’ business confidence indicator edged up to -4.9 in July 2025, from a one-and-a-half-year low of -5.0 in June. Despite the modest uptick, the figure remained well below its 20-year average of -1.3. Manufacturers became more optimistic about expected production over the next three months (4 vs 2.3 in June). However, their assessments of finished goods inventories (-7.3 vs -6.3) and order books (-11.4 vs -11.1) deteriorated further. Producer confidence remained negative across nearly all sectors. Only manufacturers in the wood and building materials industry reported a positive outlook in July, while those in the metal industry were the most pessimistic.
🇮🇳 India Stocks Muted in Morning Trade

The BSE Sensex remained largely flat, hovering around 81,361 after gains in the prior session, amid lingering uncertainty over US-India trade talks ahead of a looming tariff deadline. Traders continued to monitor developments after President Trump said that India could face tariffs of 20–25%, slightly below the 26% rate announced in April. Caution also stemmed from anticipated Q1 earnings, with major companies like Power Grid and Tata Power scheduled to release their results today. Investors were also awaiting the Fed’s interest rate decision, amid renewed pressure from President Trump for a more accommodative stance. On a positive note, the IMF upgraded India’s GDP forecast to 6.4% for both FY2026 and FY2027. Sector-wise, gains in pharmaceuticals and healthcare were offset by declines in auto and technology stocks. L

The latest figure also marked the third consecutive month of increasing household expenditures, as spending on manufactured goods (0.5% vs -0.4% in May) rebounded, mainly driven by durable goods. Moreover, energy consumption increased notably (3.5% vs 2.1%), primarily due to higher electricity expenditures. Meanwhile, food consumption declined further (-0.9% vs -0.3% in May), weighed down by a continued fall in agri-food product expenditures.

Household consumption edged up 0.1%, bouncing back from a 0.3% decline in Q1, supported by stronger goods purchases during the Easter holidays and favorable weather, especially for food, tobacco, and a strong recovery in accommodation and catering services. Government spending rose steadily (0.2% vs 0.2%). However, fixed investment shrank further (-0.3% vs -0.1%), hurt by ongoing weakness in construction and a drop in manufactured goods. Exports rose 0.2%, rebounding from a 1.1% fall in Q1, as firms rushed shipments to the U.S., while imports climbed 0.8%, driven by higher energy and industrial goods demand. Year-on-year, GDP grew 0.7%, up from 0.6% in Q1.

On a yearly basis, retail sales surged 4.9%, sharply picking up from a 2.6% gain in May and marking the strongest pace since February 2022.

Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, both seen as potential successors to Fed Chair Jerome Powell. are expected to dissent at this month’s meeting.

🇺🇸 Fed Expected to Hold Rates Steady

The Federal Reserve is expected to hold the federal funds rate steady at the 4.25%–4.50% target range for a fifth consecutive meeting in July 2025, maintaining its wait-and-see approach amid growing concerns that the ongoing trade war could reverse progress toward the 2% inflation target. The annual inflation rate accelerated for the second straight month to 2.7% in June—the highest since February—up from 2.4% in May. Core inflation also edged higher, reaching 2.9% from a four-year low of 2.8% in the previous month. Meanwhile, labor market data continues to reflect a slowdown, but overall conditions remain robust. Investors are still pricing in a 25bps rate cut in September, with expectations of up to 100bps of easing over the next 12 months. At the same time, President Trump has been intensifying pressure on the Fed to cut rates to 1%. His repeated public criticism of the central bank and threats to dismiss Chair Powell have raised concerns about the erosion of the Fed’s independence.
Iron Ore Steady as Markets Await US-China Truce Decision

Iron ore futures held just below CNY 800 per tonne on Wednesday, as investors weighed the likelihood of an extension to the US-China tariff truce. President Donald Trump must now approve the proposed plan, otherwise, tariffs will revert to April levels if no agreement is reached by the August 12 deadline. Adding to global trade concerns, a new US-EU agreement maintained existing 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum, reinforcing market fears over escalating protectionism. Investors are also focused on this week’s Politburo meeting, where potential stimulus measures may be announced to support growth. In line with those efforts, Beijing has intensified its campaign to combat deflation and rein in industrial overcapacity. President Xi Jinping recently criticized local governments for excessive investment in sectors like artificial intelligence, computing power, and new energy vehicles.
🇭🇺 Hungary Q2 GDP Grows 0.1%

Hungary’s gross domestic product expanded by 0.1% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2025, following stagnant growth in the previous three-month period, according to preliminary estimates. The modest improvement was mainly driven  by the combined performances in the services sector, particularly information and communication. However, the upturn was partially offset by the slowdown in the added value of agriculture and industry. On a seasonally adjusted quarterly basis, the economy grew by 0.4% in the second quarter of 2025, recovering from a downwardly revised 0.1% contraction in the preceding period.

This marked the weakest quarterly growth since Q1 2024, with the slowdown largely attributed to a negative contribution from the foreign trade balance. On a more positive note, household final consumption continued to increase, marking its fourth consecutive quarter of growth. On a yearly basis, the Czech economy expanded by 2.4% in Q2 2025, matching the pace seen in the preceding quarter.

Caution also grew ahead of the Fed’s rate decision later today, with analysts saying most officials prefer to assess the inflationary impact of tariffs, especially with Trump’s August 1 deadline looming.

Despite beating market expectations of flat growth, it marked the weakest pace of expansion since late 2023. The slowdown reflects growing caution among businesses and households, as they weigh easing inflation and lower borrowing costs against rising trade uncertainty, particularly due to US tariffs. Among the bloc’s major economies, Spain and France outperformed with growth of 0.7% and 0.3%, respectively. The Netherlands posted modest growth of 0.1%, while both Germany and Italy slipped into contraction, each shrinking by 0.1%.

Spain and France outperformed, expanding by 0.7% and 0.3% respectively, while Germany and Italy each contracted by 0.1%. In Spain, inflation rose more than expected in July. On the trade front, investor sentiment remained cautious amid concerns that the newly announced US-EU trade agreement favors the US, offering limited relief for the eurozone's sluggish outlook.

Markets now price in a 90% chance of a 25-basis-point cut by March 2026, while the probability of a move in December has slipped to 30%.
🇲🇰 North Macedonia Holds Key Interest Rate Steady at 5.35%

The National Bank of the Republic of North Macedonia kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 5.35% for a fourth straight meeting in July 2025, maintaining a cautious monetary stance amid elevated inflation and persistent external uncertainties. Annual inflation rose to 4.5% in June, slightly above expectations, driven mainly by higher food and core goods prices. Geopolitical tensions, trade barriers, and climate risks continue to cloud the outlook for commodity prices, adding to inflation uncertainty. Economic growth remained solid, with GDP expanding 3.0% in Q1 and signs of acceleration in Q2, supported by gains in construction, industry, and services. The foreign exchange market stayed stable, underpinned by €4.7 billion in reserves—adequate to sustain the denar’s peg to the euro. The central bank’s policy mix, including interest rates, reserve requirements, and macroprudential tools, remains focused on preserving medium-term price stability and exchange rate alignment.
Steel Pulls Back from 7-Month High

Steel futures in China fell to CNY 3,265 per tonne from the seven-month high of CNY 3,345 touched on July 29th as markets reassessed the scale in which the Chinese government will support its economy against a slowdown in consumption and a property crisis. Following its latest Politburo meeting, officials noted they will implement expansionary fiscal policy and maintain monetary backdrops loose to shore up spending, but refrained from signaling large-scale stimulus measures. Still, the outlook of lower supply and robust infrastructure spending maintained steel futures over 7% higher in the third quarter. Chinese policymakers vowed to erase overcapacity in construction inputs, with Baosteel expecting domestic output to fall by over 50 million tonnes this year due to policy bounds. In the meantime, the outlook on non-residential construction was supported by the announcement of a CNY 1.2 trillion hydropower plant project, signaling willingness to expand metal-intense projects.
🇵🇹 Portuguese Economy Returns to Growth in Q2

The Portuguese economy expanded 0.6% on quarter in Q2 2025, recovering from an upwardly revised 0.4% contraction in the first tree months of the year, preliminary figures showed. The contribution of net external demand was less negative, as exports of goods and services increased following a decline in the previous quarter. Similarly, the positive contribution from domestic demand strengthened, driven by an increase in private consumption. Year-on-year, the GDP in Portugal grew 1.9% in Q2, above an upwardly revised 1.7% in Q1. The negative contribution of net external demand was less pronounced, reflecting a sharper slowdown in imports of goods and services compared to exports. In contrast, the positive contribution of domestic demand weakened due to a deceleration in investment.
Bosnia Retail Trade Growth Hit 1-Year High

Retail sales in Bosnia and Herzegovina rose by 4.6% year-on-year in June 2025, following a 1.1% rise in the previous month. This marked the highest reading since June 2024 as retail activity rose for automotive fuel sales (13% vs 6.5% in May) and non-food products (4.2% vs -0.1%). Meanwhile, sales moderated for food, beverages, and tobacco (0.1% vs 0.2%). On a monthly basis, retail trade rose by 1.5% in June from 0.5% in May.
🇵🇹 Portugal Jobless Rate Falls to 3-Year Low

Portugal’s unemployment rate edged down to 6.0% in June 2025, from a downwardly revised 6.1% in May, marking the lowest level since March 2022. The number of unemployed fell by 5.3 thousand to 335.5 thousand, while employment increased by 8.3 thousand to 5.228 million—the highest figure since February 1998. Meanwhile, the labor underutilization rate—which includes unemployed individuals, those marginally attached to the labor force, and part-time workers seeking full-time employment—declined to 10.2% in June, down from 10.4% in May. The activity rate was unchanged at 69.3%.
🇮🇪 Ireland Retail Sales Rebound in June

Retail sales in Ireland rose by 0.6% month-over-month in June 2025, rebounding from a 0.6% fall in the previous month. The recovery was driven by improved performance in several sectors, including department stores (1.4% vs -3.7% in May), electrical goods (4.2% vs -1.3%), and books, newspapers
🇮🇳 Sensex Up for 2nd Day

India's BSE Sensex closed about 0.2% higher at 81,481.9 on Wednesday, advancing slightly for the second day, supported by strong earnings despite caution over the Fed’s upcoming decision and a delayed India-US trade deal. India is bracing for higher US tariffs of 20–25% on some exports ahead of an August 1 deadline to seal an agreement, government sources told Reuters. On the corporate front, Larsen
🇮🇳 Indian 10-Year Yield Rebounds

The yield on the Indian 10-year G-Sec rose to 6.36% from the one-month low of 6.3% touched on July 21st as growing trade tensions with the US and the consequent plunge for the rupee drove foreign investors to trim their holdings. US President Trump stated he would imposte tariffs of up to 25% on India by the start of August, above the average for other major US trading partners as the Indian delegation refrained from making a trade deal with the White House. This was magnified by Indian diplomats noting that it may take a while to agree on terms with the US, delaying expectations of softer trade barriers. The events drove the rupee to plunge near record lows and threatened demand for key industries, countering the recent optimism on the Indian budget balance. Meanwhile, the RBI is expected to deliver another rate cut this year as headline inflation fell to a six-year low of 2.1% in June, approaching the lower end of the RBI's inflation tolerance band of 2%.
🇺🇸 Mortgage Applications Fall to Lowest Since May

The volume of mortgage applications in the US fell by 3.8% from the previous week in the fourth week of July, swinging lower from the 0.8% increase in the previous week, according to data compiled by the Mortgage Bankers Association. The drop lowered the volume of mortgage applications to their lowest since May despite the softer developments in mortgage rates since the start of July, as uncertainty around the economy and the labor market drove homebuyers to be hesitant about large financial commitments. Applications for a contract to refinance a mortgage, which are more sensitive to short-term changes in interest rates, fell by 1%. In turn, applications for a mortgage to purchase a new home declined by a sharper 6%.
🇵🇰 Pakistan Central Bank Holds Policy Rate at 11%, Defying Expectations

The State Bank of Pakistan left its benchmark policy rate unchanged at 11% in July, maintaining borrowing costs at their lowest level since March 2022. The decision surprised markets, which had widely expected another cut, given the continued moderation in inflation and increasing calls to support economic growth. Consumer price inflation eased to 3.2% in June, down from 3.5% in May, aligning with the government’s projected range of 3% to 4%. For the fiscal year ending June 30, average inflation fell to a nine-year low of 4.49%, a sharp decline from 23.4% the previous year. However, the SBP signaled caution amid rising imports and renewed pressure on the currency, which could reignite inflationary risks. The central bank began its easing cycle in June 2024, cutting rates from a record 22%. After a brief pause in March 2025 following a series of 10 bps cuts, the SBP resumed easing with a 100 bps cut in May, but held steady again in June amid tensions between Iran and Israel.
🇪🇸 Spain’s Industrial Confidence Improves Slightly in July

Spain’s seasonally adjusted industry confidence indicator edged up to -4.9 in July 2025, from -5.2 in the previous month, signaling a modest improvement in sentiment. The uptick was driven by a rebound in production expectations, which rose to 1.8 from -1.5 in June. However, the gains were partially offset by further deterioration in order books, which fell to -9.6 from -9.1, and an increase in inventories of finished products, up to 6.8 from 4.9, suggesting continued demand-side weakness.
🇨🇳 Chinese Yuan Hits 5-week Low

The Chinese Yuan touched 7.19 against the USD, the lowest since June 2025. Over the past 4 weeks, US Dollar Chinese Yuan gained 0.42%, and in the last 12 months, it decreased 0.47%.
🇺🇸 US Private Sector Adds 104K Jobs in July, Beating Expectations

Private businesses in the United States added 104,000 jobs in July 2025, the strongest gain since March and well above market expectations of a 75,000 increase. The report followed a downwardly revised loss of 23,000 jobs in June, signaling a rebound in labor market momentum. The service-providing sector contributed 74,000 jobs, led by strong gains in leisure and hospitality ( 46,000), financial activities ( 28,000), and trade, transportation, and utilities ( 18,000). However, education and health services posted a sharp decline, shedding 38,000 jobs. Meanwhile, the goods-producing sector added 31,000 jobs, supported by growth in construction ( 15,000), natural resources and mining ( 9,000), and manufacturing ( 7,000).
🇮🇳 Indian Rupee Approaches Record Low on Fresh Tariffs

The Indian rupee slid further to 87.7 per USD in late July, the weakest since reaching the record low of 88 in February amid a worsening trade outlook with the US and dovish outlook for the RBI. US President Trump stated he would slap a 25% tariff on India to start on Friday, as the country refrained from striking a deal with their US counterparts. Trump also said penalties on selected industries would be much higher due to India's continued business and re-exports with Russian oil companies. The move followed signals from Indian diplomats stating that an eventual agreement would take time, denting demand for goods from one of India's main trading partners. On the monetary policy front, consumer inflation feel to a six-year low of 2.1%, well below market expectations, to test the lower bound of the RBI's inflation tolerance band of 2%. Consequently, markets expect the RBI to continue reducing its benchmark policy rate this year.
🇺🇸 US GDP Growth Tops Forecasts in Q2

The US economy grew an annualized 3% in the second quarter of 2025, rebounding from a 0.5% contraction in the first quarter, and beating market expectations of a 2.4% rise, according to advance estimates. The expansion primarily reflected a decrease in imports, following a surge in Q1, when businesses and consumers rushed to stockpile goods ahead of expected price increases following a series of tariff announcements. Consumer spending also went up. These movements were partly offset by decreases in investment and exports.
🇺🇸 US Stocks Set to Rise

Euro Slips to Lowest Since Mid-June Amid Mixed Data and Fed Focus

The euro extended losses below $1.15, hitting its weakest level since mid-June, as investors digested a slew of economic data and turned their attention to the Federal Reserve’s policy decision on Wednesday. New Eurostat figures showed the Eurozone economy grew a modest 0.1% in Q2, slowing sharply from 0.6% in Q1 but still exceeding expectations of no growth. Meanwhile, the US dollar gained strength following strong Q2 GDP numbers and robust July private employment data. On the trade front, investor sentiment remained cautious amid concerns that the recently announced U.S.-EU trade agreement disproportionately benefits the US, providing little boost to the eurozone’s sluggish outlook. Expectations for European Central Bank rate cuts have also been pushed further out. Markets now assign a 90% probability of a 25-basis-point cut by March 2026, while the likelihood of a move in December has fallen to 30%.
Baltic Dry Index Down for 4th Day

The Baltic Exchange's dry bulk sea freight index, which tracks rates for vessels transporting dry commodities, was down for a fourth session on Wednesday, plunging about 5.4% to its lowest since July 16 at 1,995 points. The capesize index, which typically transports 150,000-ton cargoes such as iron ore and coal, tumbled 8.3% to a one-week low of 3,186 points, extending losses for the third day; and the panamax index, which usually carries 60,000-70,000 tons of coal or grain, dropped about 3% to its lowest since July 9 at 1,689 points, marking its 11th consecutive session of decline. Among smaller vessels, the suprmax index fell 0.8% to a more than two-week low of 1,271 points.
🇲🇽 Mexican Peso Slips to 1-Month Low on Strong USD

The Mexican peso slid past 18.80 per USD to one-month lows as a broad rebound in the US dollar, further supported by a 3% annualized GDP surge in Q2, dovetailing with high-profile US–EU and US–Japan trade agreements that capped tariff-war fears, overwhelmed Mexico’s otherwise robust economic backdrop. Stateside, the outsized growth print reinforced market convictions that the Fed will pause for a fifth consecutive meeting. Back home, Mexico’s economy expanded 0.7% quarter-on-quarter in Q2, its strongest pace since late 2024 and well ahead of the 0.4% consensus, just as unemployment fell to 2.7% in June, the lowest since 2002, underscoring a tight labor market. Banxico’s high interest rate, and the expectation it will stay that way, keeps real yields attractive for carry-trade investors. While these inflows provide some support, they’ve only partly cushioned the peso from the dollar’s strength.
🇺🇸 Altria Hits 8-week High

Altria increased to 60.66 USD, the highest since June 2025. Over the past 4 weeks, Altria gained 1.25%, and in the last 12 months, it increased 17.52%.
🇦🇺 Australian Dollar Hits 5-week Low

🇨🇦 Bank of Canada Holds Rate as Expected

The Bank of Canada held its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2.75% in its July 2025 decision, as expected by markets, to mark the third hold following 2.25 percentage points of cuts throughout seven consecutive decisions. The Governing Council stated that the unpredictability in the magnitude of tariffs disabled policymakers from offering any guidance on the economy and the BoC's reaction function, as sectoral and baseline tariffs from the US maintained volatility in global trade. The Council noted that the Canadian economy has so far shown resilience to tariffs already mandated with employment holding up and H2 growth projections remaining optimistic under the current tariff scenario. Still, the second-quarter GDP is due to contract as exporters received fewer orders after front-loading deliveries in Q1. On the price front, the BoC expects CPI inflation to remain near the 2% target in the medium term.
🇺🇸 Starbucks Hits 4-week Low

Starbucks decreased to 90.54 USD, the lowest since June 2025. Over the past 4 weeks, Starbucks lost 0.73%, and in the last 12 months, it increased 19.83%.
🇺🇸 US Pending Home Sales Unexpectedly Fall

Pending home sales in the United States fell by 0.8% from the previous month in May of 2025, missing market expectations of a 0.3% increase and after a 1.8% rise in April. Pending sales declined in the Midwest, South, and West, but rose in the Northeast. According to NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun, "The data shows a continuation of small declines in contract signings despite inventory in the market increasing. Pending sales in the Northeast increased incrementally even though home price growth in the region has been the strongest in the country."

🇨🇱 Chile Unemployment Rises in June

Chile’s unemployment rate rose to 8.9% in the April–June 2025 period, up from 8.3% in the same period last year but slightly below market expectations of 9%. The increase was driven by a 0.6% rise in the labor force to 10.23 million, while the number of employed individuals remained virtually unchanged at 9.32 million. As a result, the number of unemployed rose by 7.2% to 0.91 million, reflecting both a 6.1% increase in people who lost their jobs and a 19.2% jump in first-time job seekers. By gender, the unemployment rate was 9.9% for women and 8.1% for men.
Oil Holds Near 5-Week High

WTI crude oil futures hovered above $69 per barrel on Wednesday, holding at a five-week high, supported by supply concerns after President Donald Trump pressured Russia with a shortened timeline to end the conflict in Ukraine. Trump gave Moscow a ten-day deadline to propose a satisfactory resolution or face consequences, including the imposition of 100% secondary tariffs on countries continuing to trade with Russia. Such measures could significantly disrupt the oil market, as major US trading partners—key buyers of Russian crude—may scale back or halt purchases amid rising compliance risks. Adding to the upward pressure, the US–EU trade deal, despite introducing a 15% tariff on most EU goods, averted a broader trade war that could have impacted a third of global trade and weakened fuel demand. On the downside, prices faced some pressure after EIA data revealed a surprise 7.7 million-barrel build in US crude inventories, defying expectations of a 2 million-barrel decline.
FX Updates: Australian Dollar  Depreciates by 0.82%

Top currency losers are Australian Dollar  (-0.82%),  Swedish Krona (-0.80%),  Indian Rupee (-0.77%),  Japanese Yen (-0.34%), Euro  (-0.62%) and British Pound  (-0.48%). Gains are led by Dollar Index (0.54%).
Gold Tests 1-Month Low

Gold fell to the $3,300 per ounce mark on Wednesday, not far from the lowest in one month, as restrictive rates by the Federal Reserve and stronger dollar halted bullion rallies from earlier in the year. The Fed is expected to hold its rates unchanged later today and give hints on how the central bank balances risks on signs of a slowdown in hiring and aggregate investments against the persistent threat of inflation. The central bank has noted that it sees tariffs by the White House as likely to be pro-inflationary, especially as higher levies will be enforced starting on Friday. In the meantime, the latest data showed that the US GDP expanded by more than expected on the second quarter, although investment slowed and private consumption slowed since the start of the year. On the trade front, the US raised their tariffs on India and Brazil, and kept the door open for tweaks to trade deals with the EU and China. Markets continued to price two 25bps rate cuts this year.
Gasoline Futures Rise Toward 6-Week High

US gasoline futures rose above $2.24 per gallon, the highest since June 20, after EIA data showed a sharper-than-expected drop in inventories. Gasoline stocks fell by 2.725 million barrels in the week ending July 25, the biggest weekly draw since late April and well above forecasts for a 0.5 million barrel decline. The surprise drawdown followed a build the previous week, signaling tighter near-term supply. Prices also gained support from geopolitical risks after President Trump shortened the deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine, stoking fears of energy supply disruptions. Still, the EIA projects softer gasoline demand this year, while refiners are prioritizing diesel and jet fuel output, contributing to a persistent gasoline glut.
🇨🇴 Colombia's Industrial Confidence Declines in June

Colombia’s Industrial Confidence Index (ICI) fell to 1.5 in June 2025, down 4.6 percentage points from May’s reading of 6.1. The monthly decline was driven by a sharp 12.7 point drop in the current volume of orders to -30 and a 3.5 point increase in inventory levels to -1.7. These were partially offset by a 2.7 point rise in production expectations for the next quarter, which reached 33. Despite the month-on-month decline, industrial confidence showed improvement on a yearly basis, rising 4.6 points from -3.1 in June 2024.
US Natgas Prices Fall to Over 3-Month Low

US natural gas futures fell to $3.02/MMBtu, the lowest since April 22, pressured by rising supply and weaker near-term demand. According to LSEG, average gas output in the Lower 48 states rose to 107.5 billion cubic feet per day in July, topping June’s record of 106.4 bcfd. The surge in production comes as forecasts point to cooler near-term temperatures, which could reduce power sector gas use for air conditioning. Weaker power burn and faltering demand expectations have weighed heavily on sentiment. However, the market is eyeing hotter weather further into August, which may revive air-conditioning demand and lift gas consumption by utilities. Some heat is beginning to appear in the 11–15 day outlooks, which could give bulls hope of a rebound. Additionally, liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand has been soft recently but could strengthen, offering further support if international buyers return.

Alphabet increased to 197.96 USD, the highest since February 2025. Over the past 4 weeks, Alphabet gained 12.27%, and in the last 12 months, it increased 14.91%.
🇬🇭 Ghana Cuts Key Policy Rate to 25%

The Bank of Ghana cut its benchmark monetary policy rate by 300 bps to 25% on July 30, citing sustained disinflation, robust growth, and stronger external buffers. Headline inflation fell to 13.7% in June, the lowest level since December 2021. Economic activity remained strong, with real GDP expanding 5.3% in Q1 2025 and non-oil GDP rising 6.8%, supported by solid gains in agriculture and services. The external sector continued to strengthen, with a provisional trade surplus of $5.6 billion and a current account surplus of $3.4 billion in the first half of 2025, both sharply higher than a year earlier. Gross international reserves rose to $11.1 billion by the end of June. The cedi appreciated 42.6% year-to-date against the US dollar. Despite a weakening global outlook, the central bank noted broadly anchored inflation expectations, improved external buffers, and growing domestic confidence, reaffirming its commitment to supporting the recovery without undermining recent gains.
🇩🇪 DAX Rises for 2nd Day

Frankfurt's DAX closed about 0.2% higher at 24,262 after a choppy session on Wednesday, marking the second straight day of mild advances. Investors assessed a slew of regional economic data and fresh corporate earnings, while also monitoring developments on ongoing trade negotiations. Domestically, Germany's economy contracted by an expected 0.1% in Q2, reversing 0.4% growth in Q1. Meanwhile, the German cabinet has approved the 2026 draft budget, which includes a record investment of €126.7 billion and planned borrowing of €174 billion, aimed at reinforcing infrastructure and defence. On the corporate front, Siemens Healthineers gained roughly 2% on strong Q3 results and upgraded guidance, while Porsche AG added 1.7% as investors welcomed its strategic overhaul, despite a lowered outlook tied to a €400 million tariff hit.
🇷🇺 Russia Unemployment Rate Holds at Record Low

The unemployment rate in Russia was unchanged from the previous month at 2.2% in June of 2025, the lowest on record, and below market expectations that it would have increased to 2.3%. The result was in line with statements from the Central Bank of Russia, flagging shortages in the labor force due to the Russian military mobilization and the reduced the capacity of the Russian economy.
🇺🇾 Uruguay Jobless Rate Drops in June

Uruguay’s unemployment rate eased to 7.3% in June 2025, down from 8.1% a year earlier. The labor force participation rate ticked down to 64.2% from 64.4% in May, while the employment rate climbed slightly to 59.5% from 59.4%. By gender, the jobless rate stood at 6.1% for men and 8.8% for women. Among age groups, unemployment was highest among those aged 14 to 24 (26.0%) and lowest among those between 55 to 64 (3.0%). The share of workers without social security coverage was 21.9%, while 9.2% of workers were underemployed.
🇺🇸 Fed Leaves Rates Steady

The Federal Reserve left the federal funds rate steady at the 4.25%–4.50% target range for a fifth consecutive meeting in July 2025, in line with expectations. Policymakers noted that although swings in net exports continue to affect the data, recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year. The unemployment rate remains low, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated.

🇺🇸 Dollar Gains After Fed

The dollar index strengthened to near 99.4 on Wednesday, rising for a fifth consecutive session as traders responded to the Federal Reserve’s latest policy decision. As expected, the Fed held the federal funds rate steady at 4.25%–4.5%, but revised its economic outlook, noting that recent indicators suggest a moderation in economic activity during the first half of the year—departing from earlier assessments that growth was proceeding 'at a solid pace.' Notably, two governors voted in favor of a rate cut—the first time since 1993 that two members dissented from the committee’s majority decision—fueling market expectations of a rate cut later this year. Meanwhile, the US economy grew at an annualized rate of 3% in Q2 2025, surpassing expectations for a 2.4% increase. Additionally, the ADP report showed a stronger-than-anticipated gain of 104,000 jobs in July.
🇧🇷 Brazilian Real Weakens to Early-June Lows

The Brazilian real slid past 5.60 per USD, its weakest since early June, after President Trump’s surprise executive order raised US tariffs on Brazilian exports to 50%, extinguishing hopes of a negotiated reprieve. By undermining the competitiveness and margins of Brazil’s agribusiness, manufacturing and aerospace industries, the move has also injected acute supply-chain and policy uncertainty, risked reciprocal protectionism and threatens to freeze the foreign investment and trade diversification Brazil needs for resilience. At the same time, the US dollar has surged to near two-month highs on a 3% annualized Q2 GDP beat, resilient labor data and Fed guidance that rates will remain on hold through the year-end. Back home, Copom appears set to maintain the Selic at a two-decade peak of 15% even as inflation cools toward target and business confidence softens, offering little relief.
🇧🇷 Ibovespa Volatile After US Tariff Decree

The Ibovespa exchanged gains and blows at the 132,500 mark on Wednesday after US President Trump signed an executive order imposing an additional 40% tariff on Brazilian goods, raising total tariffs to 50%. The measure, citing an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to the US, to take effect in seven days. The order references former President Bolsonaro’s trial in Brazil’s Supreme Court, calling it “politically motivated”. Brasília views the move as an unprecedented attempt to involve a foreign power in domestic judicial matters. Trump also sanctioned Minister Alexandre de Moraes under the Magnitsky Act. While tariffs on exports to the US could lead to a GDP loss up to 0.4%, the law implies that any company providing services to sanctioned individuals could be barred from operating with US institutions. Vale fell nearly 2%, CSN lost 0.6%, and Banco do Brasil dropped 1.4%. Petrobras ( 0.4%) and Gerdau ( 0.6%) rose.
🇺🇸 Bristol-Myers Squibb Hits 4-week Low

Bristol-Myers Squibb decreased to 46.18 USD, the lowest since July 2025. Over the past 4 weeks, Bristol-Myers Squibb lost 2.72%, and in the last 12 months, it decreased 2.55%.
🇯🇵 Yen Hits April Lows as Fed Holds Rates, BoJ Decision Eyed

The Japanese yen weakened to 149.19 per dollar on Wednesday, touching its lowest level since April, extending its slide as the US dollar rose following the Federal Reserve’s decision to hold rates steady at 4.25%-4.5%. The 9-2 vote included dissents from two governors favoring cuts amid signs of easing inflation and labor market softness. During the regular press conference, Chair Powell said no decision has been made for September, and the Fed’s outlook noted a slowdown in first-half growth, a shift from earlier “solid” assessments. Investors also weighed the outcome of US-China trade talks in Stockholm, which ended without a tariff truce extension. Domestically, focus turned to the Bank of Japan’s upcoming policy decision, with rates expected to remain steady and inflation forecasts likely to be revised higher. Political pressure also mounted on Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to resign, though he pledged to remain in office.
Euro Falls Sharply

The euro extended its decline to $1.14—the lowest level since mid-June—under pressure from a stronger dollar, as traders reacted to the Fed’s latest policy decision. The Fed kept the federal funds rate unchanged as expected but Chair Powell noted that no decisions had been made regarding September, and his hawkish tone dampened expectations for a rate cut at the next meeting. Meanwhile, fresh figures showed the Eurozone economy grew a modest 0.1% in Q2, slowing sharply from 0.6% in Q1 but still exceeding expectations of no growth. However, the data revealed asymmetries, with GDP in Germany and Italy contracting by 0.1%, while France and Spain recorded expansions. In addition, investors remain concerned that the recently announced US-EU trade agreement disproportionately benefits the US. Expectations for ECB rate cuts have also been pushed further out. Markets now assign a 90% probability of a 25bps cut by March 2026, while the likelihood of a move in December has fallen to 30%.
🇧🇷 Brazilian Real Rebounds After Exceptions on Key Exports

The Brazilian real steadied at 5.57 per USD, holding near its weakest since early June, after President Trump’s surprise 50% tariff on Brazilian exports came with carve-outs, including orange juice, pulp, energy products and aircraft parts, easing fears that entire swaths of the economy would be swept into the levy. By sparing key agricultural and industrial inputs, the exemptions have tempered the shock to Brazil’s trade flows and corporate margins even as the US dollar remains firm near two-month highs on robust Q2 GDP, resilient labor data and Fed guidance to keep rates on hold. At home Copom’s commitment to a 15% Selic and steady inflation expectations continue to underpin Brazil’s still-generous rate premium and attract carry-trade flows.

🇧🇷 Ibovespa Rises Amid Tariff Carv-Outs

The Ibovespa climbed 1% to close at 133,990 on Wednesday, buoyed by relief over last-minute carve-outs from Washington’s 50% tariff on Brazilian exports. Civil aircraft, pulp, orange juice and energy products were spared, in a decree that also controversially cites former President Bolsonaro’s Supreme Court trial as “politically motivated.” Brasília denounced the move as an unprecedented foreign intrusion into its judicial affairs, especially after President Trump sanctioned Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes under the Magnitsky Act. By preserving these vital export revenues, the US order allayed fears of a full-blown trade blockade and sent Embraer shares up 2.5% and BRF 1.8% higher. At the same time, the Federal Reserve’s decision to hold rates and split its vote reinforced expectations of unchanged US policy through the year-end, while Brazil’s own central bank signaled no imminent change to its 15% Selic rate despite cooling inflation.

The Central Bank of Brazil left its Selic rate steady at 15% in July, maintaining a cautious stance amid persistent inflation and global uncertainty. The decision reflects the Copom commitment to anchoring inflation expectations, which remain above target for 2025 and 2026, at 5.1% and 4.4% respectively. Policymakers cited increased volatility in global financial conditions driven by US fiscal and trade policies, as well as heightened geopolitical tensions. Domestically, economic activity has moderated, though the labor market remains strong, and both headline and core inflation have stayed elevated. Also, Copom emphasized the need for a prolonged period of significantly contractionary policy to steer inflation toward its 3% target. While the committee signaled a pause in its tightening cycle to assess lagging effects, it also reiterated its readiness to resume hikes if inflation pressures persist.

🇳🇿 New Zealand Equities Poised for Third Straight Monthly Gain

The NZX 50 was little changed at around 12,860 on Thursday morning, after closing lower in the prior session, as gains in commercial services and consumer durables were offset by losses in logistics and non-energy minerals. Traders digested the U.S. Fed’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged, though two governors dissented—the first double dissent since 1993. Locally, New Zealand’s business sentiment rose to a three-month high in July, on easing inflation expectations and a tight labor market. The benchmark index remains on track for a third consecutive monthly gain, up about 2% so far, amid optimism after the U.S. and China agreed to explore an extension of their 90-day tariff truce. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also downplayed concerns that President Trump might reject the deal. Top gainers included Winton Land (4.0%), South Port NZ (2.35%), and Freightways Group (1.7%), while Fletcher Building (-1.6%), Fisher
🇰🇷 Trump Unveils South Korea Trade Deal with 15% Tariff

President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that the U.S. will impose a 15% tariff on imports from South Korea as part of a new trade deal that avoids steeper levies. "I am pleased to announce that the United States of America has agreed to a Full and Complete Trade Deal with the Republic of Korea," Trump posted on Truth Social. Under the agreement, South Korea will invest USD 350 billion in U.S. projects selected by Trump and purchase $100 billion worth of liquefied natural gas and other energy products. The details and timeline of these investments remain unclear, with more announcements expected. Trump also said South Korea will remove import duties on American goods—including cars, trucks, and agricultural products—and open its markets to U.S. exports. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung is set to visit the White House within two weeks to meet with Trump.
🇮🇳 Trump Slaps 25% Tariff on India, Warns of Further Penalties Over Russia Ties

U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on Indian exports to the U.S. and hinted at further penalties over India’s energy ties with Russia. In a Truth Social post Wednesday, Trump criticized India’s trade practices, calling its tariffs “among the highest in the World” and accusing the country of maintaining “the most strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary Trade Barriers of any Country.” The move comes ahead of Trump’s August 1 deadline for new tariffs on multiple trading partners, ending hopes that India would receive more favorable terms like other Asian nations, which secured 15–20% rates. India had been an early participant in talks, following Prime Minister Modi’s February visit to the White House. In response, an unnamed Indian official said New Delhi remains engaged with Washington to pursue a “mutually beneficial trade deal.” Bloomberg previously reported India aims to finalize a bilateral agreement by fall.
🇰🇷 South Korea Industrial Output Rebounds in June

South Korea’s industrial production rose 1.6% month-over-month in June 2025, snapping a two-month losing streak and rebounding sharply from a 3.3% decline in May. The figure aligned with market expectations, supported by gains across mining, manufacturing, and electricity and gas sectors. Manufacturing output climbed 1.7% despite continued weakness in electronic components and machinery. Notably, semiconductor production jumped 6.6%, while automobile output increased 4.2%. On a year-over-year basis, industrial production also grew 1.6% in June, recovering from a 0.3% drop in May.
🇰🇷 South Korea Retail Sales Rebound in June

South Korea’s retail sales rose 0.5% month-over-month in June 2025, marking the first increase in four months. The rebound was driven by higher sales of semi-durable goods like clothing (up 4.1%) and non-durable goods such as cosmetics (up 0.3%). In contrast, sales of durable goods declined, with passenger car sales falling 1.6%. Retail sales serve as a key indicator of private consumption, offering insights into consumer behavior and overall economic sentiment.
🇯🇵 Japan Industrial Output Unexpectedly Rises

Japan’s industrial production grew by 1.7% month-over-month in June 2025, beating market consensus of a 0.6% drop and reversing from a 0.1% decline in the previous month, flash data showed. It was the first increase since March and marked the fastest pace in four months.

🇦🇪 UAE Holds Rate after Fed Move

The Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates (CBUAE) maintained its overnight deposit facility base rate at 4.40% on July 30, 2025, unchanged from the previous level. The move followed the US Federal Reserve’s decision to keep borrowing costs steady for a fifth consecutive meeting. "The CBUAE has also decided to maintain the interest rate applicable to borrowing short-term liquidity from the CBUAE at 50 basis points above the Base Rate for all standing credit facilities," the central bank said in a statement. The UAE’s base rate, which is linked to the Fed’s reserve rate, serves as a key monetary policy tool and a benchmark for overnight market interest rates in the country.
🇯🇵 Japanese Shares Rise Ahead of BOJ Policy Decision

The Nikkei 225 Index rose 0.5% to above 40,800 while the broader Topix Index gained 0.3% to 2,930 on Thursday, recouping some losses from earlier in the week as investors prepared for the latest Bank of Japan monetary policy decision. The BOJ is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged as it evaluates the economic impact of US tariff actions. However, the central bank is likely to raise its inflation forecast in its quarterly outlook amid persistent price pressures. Investors also continued to monitor trade developments after the US reached new tariff agreements with India and South Korea. Index heavyweights led the rally, with Disco up 3.7%, Fujikura 5.6%, Furukawa Electric 5.9%, Lasertec 2.8%, and SoftBank Group 1.8%.
Hong Kong Holds Base Rate at 4.75% in Line with Fed

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) kept its base rate unchanged at 4.75% on July 31, mirroring the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to maintain its target range at 5.25%–5.5% during the fifth FOMC meeting of the year despite pressure from President Trump to reduce borrowing costs. Both central banks signaled a cautious approach as they monitor the inflationary impact of U.S. tariff policies. Hong Kong’s base rate remains at its lowest level since December 2022.
🇦🇺 Australian Stocks Snap 3-Day Rise

The S
Brent Holds Near Six-Week High on Supply Fears

Brent crude oil futures rose  toward $73 per barrel on Thursday, gaining for a fourth straight session to a six-week high amid mounting concerns over tighter global supply. President Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on Indian exports and penalize its Russian oil imports. In a parallel move, the US introduced its most extensive sanctions on Iran in seven years. The combined pressure on India and Iran has fueled fears of ripple effects on refined products like diesel. Earlier in the week, Trump also gave Russia 10 days to resolve trade issues or face 100% secondary tariffs—raising the risk of market disruption as US allies may cut Russian crude purchases. On the downside, EIA data showed US crude inventories jumped by 7.7 million barrels last week—the largest increase in six months and defying forecasts for a decline. Investors now await the OPEC  meeting this weekend, with a sizable output hike expected. Oil is on track for its biggest monthly gain since September 2023.

On an annual basis, retail sales surged 4.9%.
🇦🇺 Australia Building Permits Beat Forecasts

This marked the second consecutive month of growth in dwelling approvals and the strongest since May 2023, primarily driven by a significant increase in approvals for private sector dwellings excluding houses (33.1% vs 11.3% in May). On the other hand, approvals for private sector houses declined to 2%, after a 0.5% rise in the previous month. By region, approvals increased in New South Wales (31.5%), Queensland (7.3%), Tasmania (7.2%), and South Australia (2.5%), while decreasing in Western Australia (-6.4%) and Victoria (-6.1%).

Australia's export prices fell by 4.5% quarter-on-quarter in Q2 2025, reversing a 2.1% rise in Q1 and marking the first decline in three quarters.

🇦🇺 Australia Private House Permits Fall 2% in June

Private house approvals in Australia fell 2% month-over-month to 9,142 units in June 2025, following a revised 1% decline in May, according to preliminary estimates.

🇦🇺 Australia Private Credit Growth Beats Expectations in June

Australia’s private sector credit rose 0.6% month-over-month in June 2025, matching the pace in May and exceeding market expectations of a 0.5% increase.

On a year-over-year basis, private sector credit expanded by 6.8%, slightly easing from a 6.9% increase in May.
🇸🇬 Singapore Bank Lending Hits Record Peak

Singapore bank loans increased to SGD 853.3 billion in June 2025 from SGD 844.6 billion in May. This marked the largest amount since records began in 1980, driven by higher loans to businesses (SGD 520.7 billion vs SGD 515 billion in May) and consumers (SGD 332.6 billion vs SGD 329.6 billion). Within the business sector, loans rose in agriculture, mining and quarrying (SGD 3.72 billion vs SGD 3.71 billion), manufacturing (SGD 23.9 billion vs SGD 23.4 billion), general commerce (SGD 90 billion vs SGD 88 billion), transport, storage and communication (SGD 43.1 billion vs SGD 41.2 billion), and financial and insurance activities (SGD 133.4 billion vs SGD 132.9 billion).

Gold Rebounds from 4-Week Low

Gold rose above $3,290 per ounce on Thursday, rebounding from a more than 1% drop to a four-week low in the previous session, as markets assessed recent trade moves and the Fed’s policy outlook. President Trump announced tariff measures, including removing exemptions for low-value imports and revising duties on copper and Brazilian goods. He also confirmed a 15% tariff on South Korean imports and a 25% tariff on Indian goods, while noting ongoing talks with India. Meanwhile, the Fed held interest rates steady, as expected. Chair Powell reiterated it’s too early to consider cuts and offered little guidance on timing. Markets responded by pricing in 35 bps of cuts by year-end. Investors also digested stronger-than-expected US data, with GDP growth and private employment both beating forecasts. Focus now shifts to upcoming PCE inflation and jobless claims on Thursday, followed by July’s jobs report on Friday.
🇨🇳 China Stocks Decline on Weak PMI Data

The Shanghai Composite fell 0.8% to below 3,600 while the Shenzhen Component lost 0.5% to 11,145 on Thursday, extending recent weakness as disappointing economic data weighed on sentiment. China’s official manufacturing PMI signaled a sharper-than-expected contraction in July, reflecting sluggish economic momentum and persistent trade tensions with the US. Growth in the services sector also slowed, hitting an eight-month low. Although US and Chinese officials wrapped up their latest round of trade talks in Stockholm earlier this week, President Donald Trump has yet to approve another extension of the current tariff truce. Investors are now focused on the upcoming Politburo meeting for potential stimulus signals aimed at stabilizing the economy. Among the notable laggards were Contemporary Amperex (-2.3%), Inner Mongolia Yili (-6.5%), Wuxi Apptec (-1.9%), China Northern Rare Earth (-4%), and BYD Company (-2.6%).
🇨🇳 Offshore Yuan Snaps 5-Session Decline

The offshore yuan rose to around 7.19 per dollar on Thursday, snapping a five-session losing streak, even as investors weighed disappointing PMI data against cautious optimism from the latest Politburo meeting. China’s official PMI data pointed to slowing momentum in July, with the composite PMI falling to a three-month low of 50.2 from June’s 50.7. Manufacturing activity remained in contraction territory, dropping to 49.3 from 49.7, while the services PMI eased to 50.1 — its weakest level in eight months — from 50.5. Despite the weak data, sentiment found some support from Wednesday’s Politburo meeting. The 24-member decision-making body pledged to support economic growth and rein in “disorderly competition,” amid mounting economic challenges. However, policymakers stopped short of announcing large-scale stimulus, instead shifting their focus toward addressing overcapacity issues in the economy. Over the month, the yuan is set for its first drop after two consecutive months of gains.
Hong Kong Stocks Fall for 3rd Session After China PMI Data

Shares in Hong Kong fell 222 points or 0.9% to 24,955 in early trade on Thursday, slipping for the third session following China’s weak PMI figures in July. Services activity grew the least in eight months, while manufacturing shrank for the fourth month, as growth momentum weakened. The data also highlighted rising trade risks amid steep U.S. tariffs and disruptions from extreme weather. Meanwhile, Fed Chair Powell pushed back on expectations for a September rate cut, after the central bank held rates for the fifth consecutive meeting. Losses were broad-based, led by property, consumers, and financials. Major laggards included China Overseas Land (-4.7%), Meituan (-4.4%), and KE Holdings (-3.9%). Still, the Hang Seng is on track for its third straight monthly gain, up around 3.3% so far, boosted by optimism over a possible extension of the 90-day U.S.-China tariff truce, though no concrete progress emerged from the recent talks in Stockholm, and President Trump has yet to decide.
🇰🇷 South Korean Won Steady Amid Finalized US Trade Deal

The South Korean won held near 1,390 per dollar on Thursday, extending modest gains despite continued strength in the greenback following the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates steady at 4.25%-4.5%. Meanwhile, the won's relative stability may reflect improving investor sentiment after South Korea and the US finalized a new trade agreement setting tariffs at 15%, down from the initially proposed 25%. Bank of Korea Deputy Governor Ryoo Sang-dai said the lower tariff rate and alignment with other major economies could help reduce uncertainties. This may also offer support on the won by alleviating downside pressure. US President Trump confirmed the deal on Wednesday, adding that American exports will face no tariffs under the agreement. On the domestic front, South Korea's reported stronger June retail sales ( 0.5% MoM) and industrial output ( 1.6% MoM), signaling further signs of resilience, potentially reinforcing support for the local currency.
🇯🇵 BoJ Holds Rate at 0.5% in Unanimous July Decision

The Bank of Japan maintained its benchmark short-term rate at 0.5% in July, keeping borrowing costs at their highest level since 2008 and matching market expectations. The decision was unanimous as the central bank continues its gradual normalization of monetary policy.
